Are you stuck trying to use an article on Alpha Coder or any of my open source projects to solve a technical/programming problem in your project? You're in luck! I offer paid support.

I can help you:

- Gain a deeper understanding of the subject matter of any article so that you can apply the knowledge in solving your problem.
- With a second pair of eyes to debug and fix your code.
- By giving you professional advice on what the best approaches, tools and technologies are for your use case.

You can get started by shooting me an email at __kajohterna@gmail.com__. If I'm available and can help you, I'll send you a quote and get to work once a required percentage of the amount has been paid.

__Note:__

- I don't collect payment for any questions/issues solely concerned with content on Alpha Coder. You can post a comment on this site or send me a DM on Twitter and I'll assist you ASAP completely free of charge.
- I only accept engagements that would last anywhere from a few minutes/hours to up to a month.
- I don't build projects from top to bottom or help maintain them.
