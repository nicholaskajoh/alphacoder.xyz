The formula for success is simple — drop out of school at a ripe age of 17 or so, go build the next Microsoft or Facebook, and become a billionaire in your twenties, right? In this article, I’ll share with you 4 reasons why this or similar aspirations are unrealistic and why you should probably just complete university and move on from there.  
This is an opinion piece so take it with a pinch of salt. Also, I’d love to know what you think down in the comments.

The numbers are not in your favour
----------------------------------

A common argument for dropping out is that “most successful people dropped out of college.” This implies that dropping out to “pursue your dreams” somehow increases your chances of success. I’m usually given names like Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg as examples of people who dropped out of school and became billionaires. Is there truth in this argument? Or is it a flawed way of thinking? Let’s see if the numbers can help.

While [over 60% of students enrolled for the first time in college in the US drop out](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2018/06/08/why-do-so-many-students-drop-out-of-college-and-what-can-be-done-about-it/), [only 12.5% of all billionaires on the Forbes 400 dropped out of college](https://www.businessinsider.com/billionaire-college-dropout-zuckerberg-bill-gates-2018-10?IR=T) (keep in mind that the billionaires' list consists of people from all over the world and not just the US). This implies that the probability of becoming a billionaire as a dropout is next to zero and that of becoming a billionaire as a graduate is even higher. Even if you don’t define success as becoming a billionaire, it’s not that hard to see that there’s little if any correlation between dropping out and becoming successful (whatever success means to you).

University is much more than academics
--------------------------------------

It seems people underestimate the power of large communities like a university. University is much more than studying to pass exams. It’s the people and the relationships you make. It’s the opportunities to experiment and kick-start your career. It’s the exposure to all kinds of experiences that make you well versed and mature. It’s the lessons that can be learned and applied later in life.

If you’re failing in your academics, you’ll likely fail in the real world too
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A lecturer of mine used to say “if you think the real world is more complex and school is a waste of time, prove it by doing well in your academics then I’ll know you’re serious about dropping out.” I think academic work (with the exception of PhD) is generally easier than working a 9 to 5 or starting a business where you have to solve tough problems in an unstructured environment. If you cannot maintain average to good grades, then what are you dropping out to do? I understand that some may not be studying what they want or lack interest in the academia. In some cases, this is a valid argument. But generally speaking, if you’re not disciplined and hard-working enough to do well academically, you’ll likely not be disciplined and hard-working enough to do well in the real world.

You have enough time to do all the things
-----------------------------------------

Why the rush? Why now? Why can’t you stay one or two more years? Would you really be wasting your time if you stayed? If you can’t answer questions like these properly, you should reconsider dropping out. There’s enough time to pursue your academics and do the other things you want to do. Set your priorities right!

So is dropping out “wrong”?
---------------------------

Absolutely not! In fact, there are several situations where dropping out is the best choice for an individual to make. In any case, if you do want to drop out, make sure you’re doing so for the RIGHT reasons.
