Running multiple apps on a single machine has never been easier! In this tutorial, Iâ€™ll show you how to run 3 apps on one server using Docker and Traefik.

Use case
--------

Say youâ€™re low on cash and can only rent one server, you can run your website, blog and SaaS app on the same machine (what weâ€™ll do in this tutorial). Or you can run an API (back-end) and SPA (front-end). You can even run two different websites (example1.com and example2.com) if you want.

Docker
------

Docker is the most widely used containerization software today. It allows you bundle code with itâ€™s config and dependencies, making it easy and seamless to deploy your apps on any machine (or several machines). It also helps in development by providing a consistent environment for collaborators on a project. More info here: [https://docs.docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/).

Traefik
-------

Traefik is a HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer that integrates with Docker, Swarm, Kubernetes among other orchestration tools. You can learn more here: [https://docs.traefik.io](https://docs.traefik.io/).

Docker Compose
--------------

Weâ€™ll be using Docker via Docker Compose. Docker Compose makes it easy to run multi-container Docker applications. You can configure all your containers in one file and run them at once with a single command. Read more here: [https://docs.docker.com/compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

Project setup
-------------

The 3 apps weâ€™ll be running are a website (static site), a blog and a SaaS app (dasboard-ish). For the sake of demonstration, I just downloaded HTML templates online ðŸ‘€. So I have a _landing page template_, _blog template_ and _dashboard template_. Theyâ€™ll all be served with Ngnix ðŸ˜‰.

SaaS app

Hereâ€™s the project repo: [**https://github.com/nicholaskajoh/jack**](https://github.com/nicholaskajoh/jack).

Each app is put in itâ€™s own folder, with its own _Dockerfile_. The Dockerfiles are identical since weâ€™re basically just serving static files in all the apps.

    # Dockerfile
    FROM nginx:alpine
    COPY . /usr/share/nginx/html
    

The docker compose file brings everything together under one roof. Hereâ€™s how it looks:

    # docker-compose.yml
    version: "3"
    services:
      traefik:
        image: traefik
        command: --web --docker --docker.domain=docker.localhost --logLevel=DEBUG
        ports:
          - "80:80"
          - "8080:8080"
          - "443:443"
        volumes:
          - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
          - /dev/null:/traefik.toml
      app:
        build: ./app
        volumes:
          - ./app:/usr/share/nginx/html
        labels:
          - "traefik.backend=app-be"
          - "traefik.frontend.rule=Host:app.localhost"
      blog:
        build: ./blog
        volumes:
          - ./blog:/usr/share/nginx/html
        labels:
          - "traefik.backend=blog-be"
          - "traefik.frontend.rule=Host:blog.localhost"
      website:
        build: ./website
        volumes:
          - ./website:/usr/share/nginx/html
        labels:
          - "traefik.backend=website-be"
          - "traefik.frontend.rule=Host:localhost"
    

As can be seen, traefik itself is run in a container. The domain is set to localhost and the ports 80, 8080 and 443 are published. The web flag (`--web`) under command parameter tells traefik to run its API dashboard which will be exposed on port 8080.

Traefik can be configured using a [_traefik.toml_](https://github.com/nicholaskajoh/jack/blob/master/traefik/traefik.toml) file. It can also pick configs from service labels. As such, we specified the `traefik.backend` and `traefik.frontend.rule` configs using labels. `traefik.backend` specifies the service to handle requests from `traefik.frontend.rule`. So if we go to _app.localhost_, we will be served content from the app service. Same with _localhost_ and website, and _blog.localhost_ and blog.

**Try it out:** clone [Jack](https://github.com/nicholaskajoh/jack), run `docker-compose up` and visit _localhost_, _app.localhost_ and _blog.localhost_.

Traefik dashboard
-----------------

The Traefik dashboard displays useful information including the available front-ends and back-ends, and the health of the containers. You can password protect the dashboard so only authorized persons can access it.

SSL
---

Traefik can handle SSL for you automatically. This guide ([https://docs.traefik.io/user-guide/docker-and-lets-encrypt](https://docs.traefik.io/user-guide/docker-and-lets-encrypt/)) explains the configuration process using Letâ€™s Encrypt.

**_NB:_** _I added SSL configs in_ [_docker-compose.prod.yml_](https://github.com/nicholaskajoh/jack/blob/master/docker-compose.prod.yml) _and_ [_traefik.toml_](https://github.com/nicholaskajoh/jack/blob/master/traefik/traefik.toml) _for use in production._

Scaling and load balancing
--------------------------

Traefik load balances multiple instances of a given service automatically. You can use the scale flag/parameter in docker compose to run multiple instances of your containers.
