Twenty seventeen was a wonderful one for meâ€Šâ€”â€Šprobably the best and most defining year in terms of my career and life pursuits. It was my year of quantum exposure! ðŸ”¥

Here are some highlights that might tickle your fancy:

*   I attended 4+ tech events up from 2 in 2016 and 0 in 2015.
*   I joined the GitHub Campus Expert open training program.
*   I started writing technical articles. I wrote 15 articles which had a combined ~6.5k views.
