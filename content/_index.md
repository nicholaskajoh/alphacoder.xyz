Hi there! I'm Nicholas Kajoh, a Software Engineer passionate about solving complex problems with elegant solutions. I have a keen interest in Backend Development and Computer Vision. I enjoy writing web services, poking around servers, playing with cool algorithms and figuring out how things work. I love to tackle problems in ePayments, E-commerce/Logistics, Transportation and Social Networking.

I'm also a writer, teacher and course creator. I'm the author of [Alpha Coder](/blog), a programming blog where I publish high-quality technical articles mostly on things I'm learning and excited about. I organize local workshops periodically to teach everything software development from version control with Git to containerization using Docker, as well as create comprehensive [programming courses](/courses) to teach on/offline.
