Hi there! I'm Nicholas Kajoh, a Software Engineer passionate about solving complex problems with elegant solutions. I have a keen interest in Web Development and Machine Learning. I particularly love writing web services, poking around servers, tinkering with Deep Learning models and figuring out how things work.

I'm also a writer, teacher and course creator. I'm the author of [Alpha Coder](/blog), a programming blog where I publish high-quality technical articles mostly on things I'm learning and excited about. I organize local workshops periodically to teach everything software development from version control with Git to containerization using Docker. I'll be releasing [a number of awesome courses](/courses) soon and starting a series of free webinars thereafter. Keep your eyes peeled!
