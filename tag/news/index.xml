      <description>If you haven&amp;rsquo;t yet noticed, Alpha Coder is wearing a new look! In December of 2018, I wrote about my migration from a Medium.com publication to a self-hosted Ghost installation on Vultr. Shortly after, I decided to ditch Ghost (a Node.js CMS) for Hugo (a static site generator built with Go). I also changed the blog&amp;rsquo;s design in the process. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll share my experience using Ghost and explain why I moved again.</description>

      <description>Hi everyone! I&amp;rsquo;m happy to announce that I&amp;rsquo;ll be migrating my blog Alpha Coder from Medium.com to Ghost (self-hosted) at alphacoder.xyz. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll be explaining why and how I&amp;rsquo;m migrating, and what to expect from me and the blog going forward.
Why the move? I started taking blogging more seriously sometime in early 2017. Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve been amazed by how far my writing has gone and the opportunities it has brought me (jobs, freelance gigs, speaking invites etc)—this year I had about 100k views from 30+ articles, up from 6.</description>
