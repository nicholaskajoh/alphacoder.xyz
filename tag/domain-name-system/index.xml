      <description>Some web apps, especially those for the enterprise, give every organization, team or user their own subdomain such as team-name.awesomeapp.com or org-name.beta.awesomeapp.com. These subdomains are variable, meaning that they are not predefined and can contain any valid domain name characters.
To configure wildcard subdomains, all you need to do is add a &amp;ldquo;match all&amp;rdquo; CNAME record for your domain. The way a given subdomain is handled is totally up to your application.</description>

      <description>I have a theory — that domain registrars share your search queries with resellers. Countless times I’ve had the bad experience of searching for a domain to see its availability then finding out a day/a few days later that it has been bought or made premium. Sure, it’s very possible that it may have been legitly purchased by someone else. But I’ve been in a couple forums where people have complained about the same thing.</description>
