      <description>Managing files/images can be a hassle. It can be a real pain to have to deal with uploads, storage, manipulation, administration and delivery of media content in every project you start/or are involved in.
Luckily, there are cloud platforms that take away the stress of all that, allowing you to ship faster and deliver your product(s) at scale. Cloudinary is one of such platforms. It tags itself as the media management platform for web and mobile developers — an end-to-end solution for all your image and video needs.</description>
