      <description>The number one thing people hate about Lagos is most probably being in traffic. I’ll put insecurity (A.K.A SARS) as number 2 and poor waste management as 3 but feel free to correct me on that.
Coming from a small quiet town, it took me some time to come to terms with the fact that you have to leave 2 hours (or more) early to get to where you want on time, and that there’s no such thing as “I’ll see you in the next 10 minutes”.</description>
