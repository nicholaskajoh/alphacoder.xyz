      <description>I worked on a video-based vehicle counting system (VCS) for my final year (BSc) project. I shared a demo on Twitter that went semi-viral!
In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain why and take you through how I built it, discussing how it works, how I learned the libraries used, the components of the system, the algorithms and models I experimented with and the results obtained. Let&amp;rsquo;s get started!
TL;DR: I built a video-based vehicle counting system using Python/OpenCV.</description>

      <description>I recently finished building a web search engine. Detailed in this article is how I made it. Enjoy!
About my search engine, devsearch It was a toy project. The goal was to learn how search engines work by building one, so I wanted it as minimal as possible.
The first step was to narrow my search engine to focus on content in a particular area and a specific format. The web is a very big place.</description>
