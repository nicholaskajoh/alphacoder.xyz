<p>The number one thing people hate about Lagos is most probably being in traffic. I’ll put insecurity (A.K.A SARS) as number 2 and poor waste management as 3 but feel free to correct me on that.</p>

<p>Coming from a small quiet town, it took me some time to come to terms with the fact that you have to leave 2 hours (or more) early to get to where you want on time, and that there’s no such thing as “I’ll see you in the next 10 minutes”. My route to work is pretty short and straight forward yet it takes me 1.5 hours on average to get to the office. I live at Ogudu and work at Yaba. You can get there through 3rd Mainland Bridge but I use Ikorodu Road. I cab to Ojota, then BRT to Fadeyi where I bus to Sabo and Keke (tricycle) to the office. Phewww!</p>

<p>Road to work</p>

<p>Lagos has an estimated <a href="http://worldpopulationreview.com/world-cities/lagos-population/">21 million inhabitants</a> — more than twice as populated as my favorite cities, NYC and London which have populations of <a href="http://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities/new-york-city-population/">8.5</a> and <a href="http://worldpopulationreview.com/world-cities/london-population/">8.1</a> respectively. Lagos’ population is more on par with cities like Mumbai (~22m) and Mexico City (~21m).</p>

<p><em>NB: These population numbers are estimates. Most cities haven’t had censuses in years. They’re projected using population growth among other factors.</em></p>

<p><strong>Mind you, Lagos (City) is not the same as Lagos (State). Many a Lagosian does not know the difference.</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*IDIaFWPAq5SvGPAu4idM4A.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Lagos, the City</p>

<p>Looking at the numbers, it’s little wonder that I have to fight (physically and spiritually) to enter Danfo at Jibowu. Everyday, a few million workers (at least) commute to work and back in the city.</p>

<p>It seems like Lagos has always been plagued with traffic. I hear the situation is getting worse. Obvious because the city is growing really fast as is the population. I know a handful of people who have left Lagos mainly because of the traffic situation. I think there are many more who have left for the same reason.</p>

<p>If nothing is done about this, the madness as some call it, will continue. The situation at the moment for many is waking up at 4am and still getting late to work. It’s hard to imagine something worse than this. More than the stress of moving from point A to B is the wasted hours. Imagine spending 3–5 hours commuting everyday. At 4 hours of commute a day, you would have wasted 43 days in a year. Multiply that by the number of people who live and work in Lagos. It’s a real problem!</p>

<h2 id="improving-traffic-in-lagos">Improving traffic in Lagos</h2>

<p>Identified below are 2 simple suggestions on how to make the traffic conundrum that beclouds Lagos a little palatable. Ultimately, Lagos may never be traffic free. There are just so many issues, from poor infrastructure to little or no city planning. But maybe Lagos doesn’t need to be traffic free. Even the most developed cities still face traffic congestion, to be honest (not Lagos traffic, of course).</p>

<h4 id="better-public-transit">Better public transit</h4>

<p>When I hear people in cities like NYC say public transportation is broken, I laugh in Yoruba. They’ve never being to Lagos. Public transportation is more than broken. It’s a nightmare!</p>

<p>I like the BRT thingy. It’s easier to implement compared to railway or subway, and it’s 200% safer than Danfo. I think implementing BRT throughout the city will do a lot of good.</p>

<p>Anytime you’re in traffic, try to observe the vehicles around you. Most of them have seats unoccupied. Imagine how much less traffic there would be if every vehicle had to be fully occupied to be on the road. The idea of using large vehicles (e.g buses) to convey people makes a lot of sense. There would be fewer vehicles carrying more people.</p>

<p>Also, if public transit is fast and comfortable, many would prefer to not take their cars out. Or not. Owning a car in Nigeria is more of a status symbol than for making movement convenient these days. After you graduate from the university and get a job, everyone is expecting you to buy a car. I want to believe that is changing though.</p>

<h4 id="traffic-law-enforcement-and-restrictions">Traffic law enforcement and restrictions</h4>

<p>The day before yesterday, trekking through a street in Oregun, I saw something very interesting. For whatever reason, two men came out of their vehicles and started to argue. Their cars were nicely parked to cover the two-lane road so that there was no flow of traffic. Just behind them was a very long queue of vehicles waiting to move, oblivious to what was happening in front. Amazing to say the least!</p>

<p>I can bet that 50% of all traffic congestion in Lagos is caused by either <a href="http://www.highwaycode.com.ng/"><strong>lawlessness</strong></a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braess%27s_paradox"><strong>selfishness</strong></a>. Often times, I find out that the reason why I spent 30 minutes in a traffic jam was because a spoilt vehicle wasn’t towed to the side of the road, buses were picking and dropping passengers in the middle of the road or vehicles were all trying to cross an intersection at the same time. If traffic laws are obeyed and Lagosians are just a little patient and empathic, the situation would be a lot better. Proper enforcement will see to that.</p>

<p>I also think restrictions would help reduce traffic a lot. For instance, heavy duty haulage vehicles could be restricted from moving during rush hour. Imagine if all the trailers and fuel tankers in the morning traffic jam just disappeared. The situation would be much better. Another restriction is limiting vehicular movement in and around very busy parts of the city e.g markets and business districts. Barcelona does something like this called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZORzsubQA_M">Super Blocks</a>.</p>

<p>Lastly, more toll gates could be made, with higher fees during rush hour, to discourage people from using their cars. If public transportation is good enough, this would work very well as it has in other cities.</p>

<hr />

<p>Studies have found that the solution to traffic congestion is less cars rather than more roads. Besides, there are only so much roads that can be built especially in a densely populated city like Lagos. I think the Government should be working towards reducing the number of vehicles on the roads.</p>

<p>Just another day in Lagos traffic</p>

<p>I like to think Lagos traffic is around its saturation point — that things can’t get much worse. There’s only so much congestion people can endure. When things get really bad, a good number of people would leave. Companies would relocate as well owing to reduced productivity of their workforce and/or delay in the transport of their goods and services. This would ease things a bit and help maintain the traffic situation around the saturation point.</p>

<p>However, if Lagos wants to continue to thrive and attract foreign investment in sectors like technology and finance, it has to take serious steps in an attempt to curb traffic congestion.</p>
