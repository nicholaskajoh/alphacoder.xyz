      <description>Hi everyone! I&amp;rsquo;m happy to announce that I&amp;rsquo;ll be migrating my blog Alpha Coder from Medium.com at medium.com/alpha-coder to Ghost (self-hosted) at alphacoder.xyz. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll be explaining why and how I&amp;rsquo;m migrating, and what to expect from me and the blog going forward.
Why the move? I started taking blogging more seriously sometime in early 2017. Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve been amazed by how far my writing has gone and the opportunities it has brought me (jobs, freelance gigs, speaking invites etc)‚Äîthis year I had about 100k views from 30+ articles, up from 6.</description>

      <description>The formula for success is simple‚Ää‚Äî‚Äädrop out of school at a ripe age of 17 or so, go build the next Microsoft or Facebook, and become a billionaire in your twenties, right? In this article, I‚Äôll share with you 4 reasons why this or similar aspirations are unrealistic and why you should probably just complete university and move on from there.

      <title>A tip for working on side projects</title>
      <link>http://alphacoder.xyz/side-project-tip/</link>

      <guid>http://alphacoder.xyz/side-project-tip/</guid>
      <description>Working on sides projects is a great way to build a portfolio for freelance or full-time job opportunities, crystallize your knowledge of programming languages/tools and development workflows and, if you play your cards right, earn some cool cash by commercializing your projects. But if you‚Äôve worked on a side project before, you‚Äôre probably all too familiar with the trend that is brainstorming and coming up with great ideas, starting the project, stopping along the way, abandoning the project forever, and moving on to the next one.</description>

      <description>I have a theory‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthat domain registrars share your search queries with resellers. Countless times I‚Äôve had the bad experience of searching for a domain to see its availability then finding out a day/a few days later that it has been bought or made premium. Sure, it‚Äôs very possible that it may have been legitly purchased by someone else. But I‚Äôve been in a couple forums where people have complained about the same thing.</description>

      <description>AWS provides you with a .pem file when creating an EC2 instance. You can use this file to generate SSH keys for accessing your server without the need for the PEM, as well as push to a remote Git repository on the server. Here‚Äôs how‚Ä¶
1. Copy private key in PEM to .ssh folder 1  $ cp /path/to/my-aws-ec2-instance.pem ~/.ssh/id_rsa_ec2   2. Generate and save public key 1  $ ssh-keygen -y -f /path/to/my-aws-ec2-instance.</description>

      <description>Git is ubiquitous and pretty much standard for many Software Developers nowadays as far as Version Control Systems (VCS) are concerned. There are quite a number of ways developers work using Git. The workflows individuals/teams choose usually depend on factors like project type, project size, team size, dev tools integration etc.
In this post, we‚Äôll be discussing two popular Git workflows you should know‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäGitflow and the Forking workflow.</description>

      <description>It can be overwhelming especially for newbies, to work with modern front-end tools as development processes have increased in complexity over the years. As a mostly back-end web developer, I‚Äôve had my share of confusion and frustration trying to wrap my head around how things work. This article hopes to give you a big picture/bird‚Äôs eye view of how some of the more common tools used by front-end developers today fit together and the problems they solve/are trying to solve.</description>

      <guid>http://alphacoder.xyz/on-making-lagos-a-little-saner/</guid>
      <description>The number one thing people hate about Lagos is most probably being in traffic. I‚Äôll put insecurity (A.K.A SARS) as number 2 and poor waste management as 3 but feel free to correct me on that.
Coming from a small quiet town, it took me some time to come to terms with the fact that you have to leave 2 hours (or more) early to get to where you want on time, and that there‚Äôs no such thing as ‚ÄúI‚Äôll see you in the next 10 minutes‚Äù.</description>

      <description>I recently finished building a web search engine. Detailed in this article is how I made it. Enjoy!
About my search engine, devsearch It was a toy project. The goal was to learn how search engines work by building one, so I wanted it as minimal as possible.
The first step was to narrow my search engine to focus on content in a particular area and a specific format. The web is a very big place.</description>

      <description>Running multiple apps on a single machine has never been easier! In this tutorial, I‚Äôll show you how to run 3 apps on one server using Docker and Traefik.
Use case Say you‚Äôre low on cash and can only rent one server, you can run your website, blog and SaaS app on the same machine (what we‚Äôll do in this tutorial). Or you can run an API (back-end) and SPA (front-end).</description>

      <title>How to scale an app horizontally using a load balancer</title>

      <guid>http://alphacoder.xyz/scale-an-app-horizontally-using-a-load-balancer/</guid>
      <description>As your app grows (by getting more traffic, users, data etc), the need to increase its capacity or scale arises.
One way to scale is by optimizing your code. That may involve removing unnecessary code, using better algorithms or even using a faster programming language. While it‚Äôs important to optimize the code in your app, there‚Äôs only so much the machine in which your app runs can do. The next logical step is to increase your server capacity.</description>

      <description>Managing files/images can be a hassle. It can be a real pain to have to deal with uploads, storage, manipulation, administration and delivery of media content in every project you start/or are involved in.
Luckily, there are cloud platforms that take away the stress of all that, allowing you to ship faster and deliver your product(s) at scale. Cloudinary is one of such platforms. It tags itself as the media management platform for web and mobile developers‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääan end-to-end solution for all your image and video needs.</description>

      <description>This is a follow up to my post on setting up a React-Django web app. You can take a quick glance if you‚Äôve not seen it yet.
TL;DR: The setup is deployed at http://react-django.herokuapp.com (nothing much there actually) and the code at https://github.com/nicholaskajoh/React-Django.
We‚Äôre going to be deploying the app we setup in the previous post on Heroku. Heroku is a popular cloud hosting platform (PaaS) and offers a generous free tier which we‚Äôll be using.</description>

      <description>There are several reasons why you might not want to have separate code bases for the front and back end of your app. For one, the project becomes more portable since it can live in one repository/folder. Then again, everything can be deployed on just one server.
TL;DR: https://github.com/nicholaskajoh/React-Django.
Here‚Äôs a simple setup for creating a React-Django project. With just a few tweaks, you can swap out React for Angular or Vue.</description>

Say you‚Äôre learning a new framework or testing out some code and you want to throw in some grid love so that things look a little organized on the page. Would you rather include the heavyweight champ that is Bootstrap, or scribble a few lines of grid code?</description>

CSS helps you style HTML and Javascript is &amp;ldquo;an object-oriented computer programming language commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers.</description>
