    <p>As a Node.js developer, you know just how large (in terms of number of files and directory size) node_modules can be (you&rsquo;ve probably aready seen <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/6s0wov/heaviest_objects_in_the_universe/">the memes</a>). But have you ever asked WHY? I hadn&rsquo;t, up until recently, after which I did some goofing around on the interwebs out of curiosity.</p>
<p>Turns out it has to do with 2 things:</p>
<ol>
<li>How npm (the Node package manager) resolves dependencies.</li>
<li>How the Node.js community likes to develop packages.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="dependency-resolution">Dependency resolution</h1>
<p>npm differs from other popular package managers such as pip and RubGems in terms of how it resolves dependencies. npm may download multiple versions of a package where as pip/RubyGems will attempt to find a single version that satisfies all its dependents.</p>
<p>Say your app has 2 dependencies <em>Package A</em> and <em>Package B</em>, and <em>Package B</em> depends on <em>Package C</em>, and <em>Package A</em> and <em>Package C</em> depend on <em>Package D</em>.</p>
<p>npm <em>might</em> resolve your dependencies like so i.e downloading 2 copies of <em>Package D</em>.</p>
<p><img src="/images/nde-mdls/npm-dep-graph.png" alt=""></p>
<p>On the other hand, pip/RubyGems will download 1 version of <em>Package D</em> which satisfies <em>Package A</em> and <em>Package C</em>.</p>
<p><img src="/images/nde-mdls/pip-rubygems-dep-graph.png" alt=""></p>
<p>At first glance, the pip/RubyGems strategy might seem like the better approach but each has its pros and cons.</p>
<p>While the pip/RubyGems dependency management approach conserves space, it can lead to &ldquo;dependency hell&rdquo; i.e a situation where the package manager is unable to find a version of a package that satisfies all its dependents. In such a case, the developer will have to fix things manually. This may involve upgrading/downgrading one or more dependencies and/or eliminating them entirely. As you might imagine, this can be a pain. Doing the job of a package manager is not fun. And should you decide to downgrade a package, you might be opening up your app to vulnerabilities. As your app grows and you add more dependencies, you are more likely to face dependency hell.</p>
<p>The npm approach solves the dependency hell problem. If <em>Package A</em> requires v2 of <em>Package D</em> and <em>Package C</em> requires v5 of <em>Package D</em>, npm will download both versions. This is neat, but it doesn&rsquo;t come without its challenges. As you are already well aware, your app bundles become very large. But there&rsquo;s another problem that could occur in this approach. If you have one of more packages that expose a dependency as part of their interface, you might encounter version conflicts. For instance, if you have the latest version of React as a dependency in your project and you also have a component library dependency that uses an old version of React, you&rsquo;d most likely encounter compatibility issues that might not be easy to detect at first glance. With the pip/RubyGems approach, you&rsquo;d catch the problem pretty much at the start while trying to install the dependencies. Fortunately though, npm has a solution for this: <a href="https://nodejs.org/es/blog/npm/peer-dependencies/">peer dependencies</a>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth mentioning that npm optimizes your dependency graph by employing deduplication i.e if <em>Package A</em> and <em>Package C</em> require v1 of <em>Package D</em>, npm will only download one copy of <em>Package D</em>. You can run <code>npm ls</code> in your project&rsquo;s root directory to view the &ldquo;deduped&rdquo; packages in your dependency graph. Check out <a href="https://gist.github.com/nicholaskajoh/a4b068818b965b95f6eae3aa285e4fc3">the deduplicated packages</a> in <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/knex">Knex</a>, the SQL query builder.</p>
<p>Looking at these 2 dependency management strategies with the merits and demerits in mind, the npm approach seems like the better one to me, but I may be biased.</p>
<h1 id="small-packages">Small packages</h1>
<p>The Node.js community is &ldquo;notorious&rdquo; for building <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/~sindresorhus">very small packages</a>. It&rsquo;s also big on reusing as much code as possible. The end result is npm packages that can easily contain a dozen or more dependencies which in turn have their own dependencies. Take Knex for example. As at the time of writing this article, it has 17 direct dependencies — dev dependencies not included (<code>npm ls --only=prod --depth=0 | wc -l</code>) — and a total of 257 dependencies (<code>npm ls --only=prod | wc -l</code>). This means if you start and new Node project and run <code>npm install knex</code>, you&rsquo;d have 257 dependencies on your hands right off the bat!</p>
<p>One could argue that this pattern of building small packages and using lots of dependencies is fueled by npm&rsquo;s dependency management strategy. If npm used the pip/RubyGems approach, Node.js developers would be wary of having many dependencies for fear of dependency hell. Perhaps there&rsquo;s just one reason for the Node.js black hole. Having explored it, it seems pretty reasonable to me!</p>
